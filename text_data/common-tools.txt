# Common Tools

PydanticAI ships with native tools that can be used to enhance your agent's
capabilities.

## DuckDuckGo Search Tool

The DuckDuckGo search tool allows you to search the web for information. It is
built on top of the [DuckDuckGo
API](https://github.com/deedy5/duckduckgo_search).

### Installation

To use
[`duckduckgo_search_tool`](../api/common_tools/#pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo.duckduckgo_search_tool),
you need to install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the
`duckduckgo` optional group:

pipuv

    
    
    pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[duckduckgo]"
    
    
    
    uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[duckduckgo]"
    

### Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the DuckDuckGo search tool with an agent:

main.py

    
    
    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    from pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo import duckduckgo_search_tool
    
    agent = Agent(
        'openai:o3-mini',
        tools=[duckduckgo_search_tool()],
        system_prompt='Search DuckDuckGo for the given query and return the results.',
    )
    
    result = agent.run_sync(
        'Can you list the top five highest-grossing animated films of 2025?'
    )
    print(result.data)
    """
    I looked into several sources on animated box‐office performance in 2025, and while detailed
    rankings can shift as more money is tallied, multiple independent reports have already
    highlighted a couple of record‐breaking shows. For example:
    
    • Ne Zha 2 – News outlets (Variety, Wikipedia's "List of animated feature films of 2025", and others)
        have reported that this Chinese title not only became the highest‑grossing animated film of 2025
        but also broke records as the highest‑grossing non‑English animated film ever. One article noted
        its run exceeded US$1.7 billion.
    • Inside Out 2 – According to data shared on Statista and in industry news, this Pixar sequel has been
        on pace to set new records (with some sources even noting it as the highest‑grossing animated film
        ever, as of January 2025).
    
    Beyond those two, some entertainment trade sites (for example, a Just Jared article titled
    "Top 10 Highest-Earning Animated Films at the Box Office Revealed") have begun listing a broader
    top‑10. Although full consolidated figures can sometimes differ by source and are updated daily during
    a box‑office run, many of the industry trackers have begun to single out five films as the biggest
    earners so far in 2025.
    
    Unfortunately, although multiple articles discuss the "top animated films" of 2025, there isn't yet a
    single, universally accepted list with final numbers that names the complete top five. (Box‑office
    rankings, especially mid‑year, can be fluid as films continue to add to their totals.)
    
    Based on what several sources note so far, the two undisputed leaders are:
    1. Ne Zha 2
    2. Inside Out 2
    
    The remaining top spots (3–5) are reported by some outlets in their "Top‑10 Animated Films"
    lists for 2025 but the titles and order can vary depending on the source and the exact cut‑off
    date of the data. For the most up‑to‑date and detailed ranking (including the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
    highest‑grossing films), I recommend checking resources like:
    • Wikipedia's "List of animated feature films of 2025" page
    • Box‑office tracking sites (such as Box Office Mojo or The Numbers)
    • Trade articles like the one on Just Jared
    
    To summarize with what is clear from the current reporting:
    1. Ne Zha 2
    2. Inside Out 2
    3–5. Other animated films (yet to be definitively finalized across all reporting outlets)
    
    If you're looking for a final, consensus list of the top five, it may be best to wait until
    the 2025 year‑end box‑office tallies are in or to consult a regularly updated entertainment industry source.
    
    Would you like help finding a current source or additional details on where to look for the complete updated list?
